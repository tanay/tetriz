A text-mode game based on the classic game Tetris...


Tetriz is a simple game written in C, using Ncurses for the terminal graphics.
It is based on the classic game Tetris (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)...


LICENSE:
--------
GPLv3 (and above)


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:
--------------------
Linux, and other POSIX systems. Tetriz requires only pthreads and ncurses, so 
any POSIX based system should be able to build/run it. It should be possible to 
run it under Windows using existing Unix-like environments like Cygwin. I 
haven't tried to build/run it on systems other than Linux, and any kind of
contributions are more than welcome :)


USAGE:
------
To build Tetriz, run 'make' inside the directory where you have the source.

    $ make

NOTE: you need to have gcc installed, along with development packages for 
      pthreads and ncurses. Refer your distribution documentation for how to 
      obtain these packages.

To play the game, run the executable 'tetriz'.

    $ ./tetriz

Enjoy!
